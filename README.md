# Coin Maker Scripts and Resources
Greetings!  These are in work scripts and resources to make your own fantasy coins with OpenSCAD and Python!  (Well, you don't really need the Python, but it sure helps with automating things.)

# The Process
## What you will need:
In order to use these files, you will need some things:
- Height Map images for your coin sides.  (See sample images for examples - grayscale is all you need.  Pure white will stand out the most, and pure black will be recessed the most.)
- A .csv file with how you want the coins constructed (will have the format a biit later in these instructions)
